  manual charge for a one-time proration

when a transaction occurs, here is what to store



  a recurring charge is created starting the first of the next month

standard users adds lead syndicator for 49.99/month


a new user enters promo code and receives premium service for 50/month for 6 months (when it is usually 150/month)
  at month 5 we change the price of premium to be $100/month
    when they run out of their promo at month 6, they go to 100/month

on the 10th a standard user pays 19.99 to subscribe. that month they consumed 7 golden leads, 10 silver leads, and 13 comparable leads as well purchased lead syndicator and a feature listing
  prorate out the 19.99 for the 21 or so days of the month and bill immediately
  lead syndicator and a feature listing are prorated by date of purchase to end of billing period (end of month) -- bill immediately
  the leads are paid for at the end of the current billing period (1st of the next month)

how would you do the above if they prepaid 350
  









Feature pricing

One off, Monthly, bi-monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, annually
Consumables


Proration
  From calendar time (day/hour/min) to calendar time (optionally including some amoutn of time (1 day))

Prepaid billings and allocation
  Accrual based system
    We don't earn anything until the feature has been delivered/consumed
    Prepaids are a liability until earned

Payment priority sequence
  Based on charge codes, where prepaid or other money goes first
  billing priority can be configured to be current time period per feature back, or oldest due time period for feature forward (IRS Style)

Auto-billing
  Progressive insurance
  Once a month e-mail saying your account ending in will be billed this date and time unless you login and pay by this time
  flat rate - x $ this date per month (not good)
  variable rate - pay the ledger in full up to CAP (good)
  watch out for pulling people twice, people get overdrafted and get pissed

  you could do an algorithm where we look at the average payments per account per month, and if one is x # of std deviations away from the average, a human must authorize first
  


What about payments that aren't over the web



Delinquency
  Late fees may be tied to a specific feature

    One time late fee on the 6th, increasing by $5/day but capped at $50 per rent fee
