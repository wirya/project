model generation

project models
  these have code above and beyond the schema that needs to be injected to any models that are generated with a matching name (eg., user)

custom code
  2 classes in one file?

model synchronization

creating models in project and pushing them to db?
creating models in db and sucking into project


abstract or weird queries - run all the time with reports

// this should return an associate array
$result = Database::newQuery('pagemass', 'SELECT table1.field1 FROM a1,a2,b WHERE a1.id = a2.id AND b.name = 'bacon');

// jacked up where clause on a model read

$session = Session::read($key, $value);


user
user_login_history

I want to see how many login attempts a user have been tried against a username in the last period of time

SELECT * FROM user_login_history, user WHERE user.id = user_login_history.user_id AND time_added < '2010-09-09 00:00:00' AND time_added > '2010-08-09 00:00:00'

$User->getUserLoginHistory()->Where('2010-09-09 00:00:00' AND time_added > '2010-08-09 00:00:00')->Execute();



I want to paginate through all of the users

SELECT * FROM user LIMIT 1, 10
SELECT * FROM user LIMIT 10, 20
SELECT * FROM user LIMIT 20, 30

UserList::read()->Limit(1, 10)->Execute();
UserList::read()->Limit(10, 20)->Execute();
UserList::read()->Limit(20, 30)->Execute();


I want to read out all of the permissions a user has for their account

SELECT * FROM user_account_permission WHERE user_account_permission.user_id = 10

$User->getAccountPermissions()->execute()



I want to store a new solution provider in the database

INSERT INTO solution_provider (name) VALUES ('kam')

$sp = new SolutionProvider(kam);
$sp->save();

$sp = new SolutionProvider();
$sp->setName('kam');
$sp->save(true);





I want to sum all of a users transactions in the last time period


SELECT SUM(transaction_amount) FROM account_transaction where account_transaction.account_id = 30


$Account->count('transaction_amount')->where('time > now()');
$Account->sum('transaction_amount')->where('time > now()');



I want to receive a giant-A list of different data points from atlas and store them in the database

We'll talk about this biatch
